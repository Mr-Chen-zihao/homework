wait times = 51200 bit  
For 100Mbps wait times = 51200 / 100 000 000 = 512us  
For 1Gbps wait times = 51200 / 1 000 000 000 = 51.2us

|    Time   |                     Event                             |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|     0     |               A and B start transmission              |
|    245    |               A and B detect collisions               |
|    293    |      A and B end congestion signal transmission       |
|245+293=538|    B the last bit arrives at a; A detect idle lines   |
|538+ 96=634|                  A start transmission                 |
|293+512=805|                    B back to step 2                   |
|           |B must perform 96bit idle detection before transmission|
|634+245=879|                 Transmission of A to B                |  

Since the retransmission of a arrives at B before the scheduled retransmission time of B,  
B does not transmit during the retransmission of A. therefore, a and B do not collide.  
The factor 512 in the exponential backoff algorithm is large enough
