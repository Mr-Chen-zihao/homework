> P9. Consider the count-to-infinity problem in the distance vector routing. Will  the count-to-infinity problem occur if we decrease the cost of a link? Why?  How about if we connect two nodes which do not have a link?

No, the count-to-infinity problem occur if we decrease the cost of a link as according to the updates received the nodes find their new least costs and in turn send their updates for distance vector.

If we connect two nodes, the data cannot be propagated properly as face to cost-to-infinity problem and the find the minimum cost paths results in errors.
