## **Homework 10**
1. **Consider the following network. With the indicated link costs, use Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm to compute the shortest path from x to all network nodes. Show how the algorithm works by computing a table similar to Table 5.1.**

2. **Consider the network shown below, and assume that each node initially knows the costs to each of its neighbors. Consider the distance-vector algorithm and show the distance table entries at node z.**

3. **Consider the count-to-infinity problem in the distance vector routing. Will the count-to-infinity problem occur if we decrease the cost of a link? Why? How about if we connect two nodes which do not have a link?**

A: No, it won't occur if we decrease the cost of a link because the decreasing link cost won’t cause a loop. If we connect two nodes, it's like decrease the cost of a link.
