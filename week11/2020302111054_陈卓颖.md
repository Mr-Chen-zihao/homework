P3.  
Consider the following network. With the indicated link costs, use Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm to compute the shortest path from x to all network nodes. Show how the algorithm works by computing a table similar to Table 5.1.  

- Solution:  

| step |    N'   | D(y),p(y) | D(z),p(z) | D(w),p(w) | D(v),p(v) | D(u),p(u) | D(t),p(t) | 
| ---- | ------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
|  0   | x       |    6,x    |    8,x    |    6,x    |  **3,x**  |     ∞     |     ∞     |
|  1   | xv      |  **6,x**  |    8,x    |    6,x    |           |    6,v    |    7,v    |
|  2   | xvy     |           |    8,x    |  **6,x**  |           |    6,v    |    7,v    |
|  3   | xvyw    |           |    8,x    |           |           |  **6,v**  |    7,v    |
|  4   | xvywu   |           |    8,x    |           |           |           |  **7,v**  |
|  5   | xvywut  |           |  **8,x**  |           |           |           |           |
|  6   | xvywutz |           |           |           |           |           |           |


P5.  
Consider the network shown below, and assume that each node initially knows the costs to each of its neighbors. Consider the distance-vector algorithm and show the distance table entries at node z.  

- Solution:
D<sub>z</sub>v = min{c(z,v)+D<sub>v</sub>v, c(z,x)+D<sub>x</sub>v} = c(z,x)+D<sub>x</sub>v = 5  
D<sub>z</sub>x = min{c(z,x)+D<sub>x</sub>x, c(z,v)+D<sub>v</sub>x} = c(z,x)+D<sub>x</sub>x = 2  
D<sub>z</sub>u = min{c(u,v)+D<sub>z</sub>v, c(u,y)+D<sub>z</sub>y} = c(u,v)+D<sub>z</sub>v = 6  
D<sub>z</sub>y = min{c(y,x)+D<sub>z</sub>x, c(y,u)+D<sub>z</sub>u} = c(y,x)+D<sub>z</sub>x = 5


P9.  
Consider the count-to-infinity problem in the distance vector routing. Will the count-to-infinity problem occur if we decrease the cost of a link? Why? How about if we connect two nodes which do not have a link?

- Solution:  
The count-to-infinity problem will not occur if we decrease the cost of a link because the node will find their new least cost and update their distance vector. The count-to-infinity problem will not occur either if we connect two nodes which do not have a link.
