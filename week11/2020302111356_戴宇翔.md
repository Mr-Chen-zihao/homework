### Question 3 Chapter 5 Problem 9

Consider the count-to-infinity problem in the distance vector routing. Will the count-to-infinity problem occur if we decrease the cost of a link? Why? How about if we connect two nodes which do not have a link?

answer:

No, it won't. Because this structure won't form a loop. Loops are usually caused by a sudden increase in link costs.  

No, it won't. Because the new connection establishing equals to increasing conditions of a link.
