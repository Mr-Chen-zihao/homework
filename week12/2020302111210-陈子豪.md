Since Z wants to transmit the traffic of Y, Z will send routing advertisement to y in this way.  
In this way, when y has a datagram sent to an IP that can be reached through Z, y will be able to choose to send the datagram through Z.  
However, if Z forwards routes to y, y can re register these routes to X. Therefore.  
In this case, Z cannot block the transmission from X to Z.
