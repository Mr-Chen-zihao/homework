# Week 10

## P11

>  Consider a router that interconnects three subnets: Subnet 1, Subnet 2, and Subnet 3. Suppose all of the interfaces in each of these three subnets are required to have the prefix 223.1.17/24. Also suppose that Subnet 1 is required to support at least 60 interfaces, Subnet 2 is to support at least 90 interfaces, and Subnet 3 is to support at least 12 interfaces. Provide three network addresses (of the form a.b.c.d/x) that satisfy these constraints.



Ans:

223.1.17.0/26

223.1.17.128/25

223.1.17.192/28





## P20

> In this problem, we’ll explore the impact of NATs on P2P applications. 
> Suppose a peer with username Arnold discovers through querying that a peer with username Bernard has a file it wants to download. Also suppose that Bernard and Arnold are both behind a NAT. Try to devise a technique that will allow Arnold to establish a TCP connection with Bernard without application-specific NAT configuration. If you have difficulty devising such a technique, discuss why.



Ans:

It’t not possible to devise such a technique. Arnold  or  Bob  must  initiate  a  connection  to  the other if Arnold  and  Bernard have a direct TCP connection. But the NATs covering Arnold and Bob drop SYN packets arriving from the WAN side. Thus neither Arnold nor Bob can initiate a TCP connection to the other if they are both behind NATs.
