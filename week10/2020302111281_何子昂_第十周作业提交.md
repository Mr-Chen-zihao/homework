Subnet 1 needs more than 60 interfaces. $ 2^{5}<60<2^{6} $
and the prefix should be 223.1.17/24. Thus, the first 24 bits need to be 223.1.17, and let the last 6 bits are 0.
So, subnet 1's address is 223.1.17.0/26  
Subnet 2 needs 90 interfaces. It is 223.1.17.128/25. Subnet 3 needs 12 interfaces. It is 223.1.17.240/28
## P20
It was impossible to come up with such a technology. In order to establish a direct TCP connection between Arnold and Bernard, Arnold or Bob must initiate another connection. But the NAT that covers Arnold and Bob discards SYN packets arriving from the WAN. Therefore, neither Arnold nor Bob can initiate a TCP connection to the other if they are behind NAT.
