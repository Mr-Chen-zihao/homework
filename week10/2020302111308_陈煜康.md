#### P 11

<font color="gray">Consider a router that interconnects three subnets: Subnet 1, Subnet 2,  and Subnet 3. Suppose all of the interfaces in each of these three subnets  are required to have the prefix 223.1.17/24. Also suppose that Subnet 1 is  required to support at least 60 interfaces, Subnet 2 is to support at least 90  interfaces, and Subnet 3 is to support at least 12 interfaces. Provide three  network addresses (of the form a.b.c.d/x) that satisfy these constraints.</font>

subnet 1:  223.1.17.128~223.1.17.192(subnet mask: 255.255.255.192)

subnet 2:  223.1.17.1~223.1.17.127(subnet mask: 255.255.255.128)

subnet 3:  223.1.17.193~223.1.17.255(subnet mask: 255.255.255.192)



#### P 20

<font color="gray"> In this problem, weâ€™ll explore the impact of NATs on P2P applications.  Suppose a peer with username Arnold discovers through querying that a  peer with username Bernard has a file it wants to download. Also suppose  that Bernard and Arnold are both behind a NAT. Try to devise a technique  that will allow Arnold to establish a TCP connection with Bernard without  application-specific NAT configuration. If you have difficulty devising such  a technique, discuss why. </font>

It's difficult to establish such a TCP connection. If the two sides of the connection are in the same NAT, the server won't reply SYN and ACK message to the client thus the connection won't be established successfully.
