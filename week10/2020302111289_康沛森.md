>  <strong>P11</strong> Consider a router that interconnects three subnets: Subnet 1, Subnet 2, 
and Subnet 3. Suppose all of the interfaces in each of these three subnets 
are required to have the prefix 223.1.17/24. Also suppose that Subnet 1 is 
required to support at least 60 interfaces, Subnet 2 is to support at least 90 
interfaces, and Subnet 3 is to support at least 12 interfaces. Provide three 
network addresses (of the form a.b.c.d/x) that satisfy these constraints.<br><br>
<strong>
a. <br>
223.1.17.0/26<br>
223.1.17.128/25<br>
 223.1.17.192/28<br>

><strong>P20</strong>In this problem, we’ll explore the impact of NATs on P2P applications. 
Suppose a peer with username Arnold discovers through querying that a 
peer with username Bernard has a file it wants to download. Also suppose 
that Bernard and Arnold are both behind a NAT. Try to devise a technique 
that will allow Arnold to establish a TCP connection with Bernard without 
application-specific NAT configuration. If you have difficulty devising such 
a technique, discuss why.<br><br>

<strong>
无法实现该技术，两人都在NAT下，而NAT会丢弃SYN包，这使得两人建立TCP链接是不可能的。
