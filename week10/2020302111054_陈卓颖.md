P11. Consider a router that interconnects three subnets: Subnet 1, Subnet 2, and Subnet 3. Suppose all of the interfaces in each of these three subnets are required to have the prefix 223.1.17/24. Also suppose that Subnet 1 is required to support at least 60 interfaces, Subnet 2 is to support at least 90 interfaces, and Subnet 3 is to support at least 12 interfaces. Provide three network addresses (of the form a.b.c.d/x) that satisfy these constraints.

- Solution:
Subnet 2: 223.1.17.0/25
Subnet 1: 223.1.17.128/26
Subnet 3: 223.1.17.192/26


P20. In this problem, weâ€™ll explore the impact of NATs on P2P applications. Suppose a peer with username Arnold discovers through querying that a peer with username Bernard has a file it wants to download. Also suppose that Bernard and Arnold are both behind a NAT. Try to devise a technique that will allow Arnold to establish a TCP connection with Bernard without application-specific NAT configuration. If you have difficulty devising such a technique, discuss why.

- Solution:
I think it is not possible for most cases because NAT will drop SYN packets which is essential for a TCP connection, but both Arnold and Bernard are behind a NAT. However, there might be some special NATs that can deal with SYN packets correctly and TCP connection can be established.
