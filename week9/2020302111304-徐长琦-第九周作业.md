**a)**

Taken the given data and figure:

Suppose that the forwarding table in router A, such that all traffic destined to host H3 is forwarded through interface 3 in datagram network..

It contains,

- Destination address
- Link Interface

**b)**

No.

It is not possible for a forwarding table in router A, such that all traffic from H1 destined to host H3 is forwarded through interface 3, while all traffic from H2 destined to host H3 is forwarded through interface 4.

The minimal number of time slots needed is 3. The scheduling is as follows.

Slot 1: send X in top input queue, send Y in middle input queue.   

Slot 2: send X in middle input queue, send Y in bottom input queue

Slot 3: send Z in bottom input queue.

 Largest number of slots is still 3. Actually, based on the assumption that a non-empty input queue is never idle, we see that the first time slot always consists of sending X in the top input queue and Y in either middle or bottom input queue, and in the second time slot, we can always send two more datagram, and the last datagram can be sent in third time slot. NOTE: Actually, if the first datagram in the bottom input queue is X, then the worst case would require 4 time slots.

**a)**

 

**Consider the FIFO(First In First Out) service:**

The time at which packets 2 through 12 each leave the queue. So, the packet that entered the queue first(arrival time), leaves the queue first(leaving time) for the FIFO service.



 The following table is used to calculate the delay between its arrival and the beginning of the slot in which it is transmitted by using given figure:



| packet | Arrial time | leaving time | delay time |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| 1      | 0           | 0            | 0          |
| 2      | 0           | 1            | 1          |
| 3      | 1           | 2            | 1          |
| 4      | 1           | 3            | 2          |
| 5      | 3           | 5            | 2          |
| 6      | 2           | 4            | 2          |
| 7      | 3           | 6            | 3          |
| 8      | 5           | 7            | 2          |
| 9      | 5           | 8            | 3          |
| 10     | 7           | 9            | 2          |
| 11     | 8           | 10           | 2          |
| 12     | 8           | 11           | 3          |

Average delay = all delay time/number of packets = 1.92



**b)**

 

**Consider the priority queue service:**

Assume that odd-numbered(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) packets are high priority and even-numbered(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 ) packets are low priority. So, the packet with higher priority is transmitted before the packet with lower priority for priority queuse service.

The following table data is used to calculate the delay between its arrival and the beginning of the slot in which it is transmitted by using given figure:



| packet | Arrial time | leaving time | delay time |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| 1      | 0           | 0            | 0          |
| 2      | 0           | 2            | 2          |
| 3      | 1           | 1            | 0          |
| 4      | 1           | 6            | 5          |
| 5      | 3           | 4            | 1          |
| 6      | 2           | 7            | 5          |
| 7      | 3           | 3            | 0          |
| 8      | 5           | 9            | 4          |
| 9      | 5           | 5            | 0          |
| 10     | 7           | 10           | 3          |
| 11     | 8           | 8            | 0          |
| 12     | 8           | 11           | 3          |

average delay = 1.92

**c)**

 

**Consider the round robin service:**

Assume that packets 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, and 12 are from class 1, and packets 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are from class 2 as a packet of each class leaves the queue alternatively in a round robin service.

The following table data is used to calculate the delay between its arrival and the beginning of the slot in which it is transmitted by using given figure:



| packet | Arrial time | leaving time | delay time |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| 1      | 0           | 0            | 0          |
| 2      | 0           | 2            | 2          |
| 3      | 1           | 4            | 3          |
| 4      | 1           | 1            | 0          |
| 5      | 3           | 3            | 0          |
| 6      | 2           | 6            | 4          |
| 7      | 3           | 5            | 2          |
| 8      | 5           | 7            | 2          |
| 9      | 5           | 9            | 4          |
| 10     | 7           | 11           | 4          |
| 11     | 8           | 8            | 0          |
| 12     | 8           | 10           | 2          |

average delay time = 1.92



**d)**

 

**Consider the weighted fair queueing (WFQ) service:**

Assume that odd- numbered packets(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 ) are from class 1, and even-numbered packets(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 ) are from class 2 as 2 packets of class 1 leaves in a turn and then the turn comes to class 2 and only one packet may leave in one turn.

The following table data is used to calculate the delay between its arrival and the beginning of the slot in which it is transmitted by using given figure:



| packet | Arrial time | leaving time | delay time |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| 1      | 0           | 0            | 0          |
| 2      | 0           | 2            | 2          |
| 3      | 1           | 1            | 0          |
| 4      | 1           | 5            | 4          |
| 5      | 3           | 3            | 0          |
| 6      | 2           | 7            | 5          |
| 7      | 3           | 4            | 1          |
| 8      | 5           | 9            | 4          |
| 9      | 5           | 6            | 1          |
| 10     | 7           | 10           | 3          |
| 11     | 8           | 8            | 0          |
| 12     | 8           | 11           | 3          |

average delay time = 1.92

**e)**

 

The aveerage delay over all 12 packets values are equal, but the delays of the packet values are different for FIFO, RR,priority, and WFQ.
